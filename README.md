# AzulCandidateTest

This is a simple project that proves this statement

>Java programâ€™s behavior may vary depending on the order of the classpath arguments in the command line that launches it.

In order to execute it by yourself you should follow these instructions:


### Mac/Linux:
From the root folder (make sure you have Java installed) execute these commands in the terminal
```
javac src/main/Main.java src1/first/MyDummySingleton.java
javac src2/first/MyDummySingleton.java  
java -cp src:src1:src2 main.Main
java -cp src:src2:src1 main.Main
```

### Windows:
From the root folder (make sure you have Java installed) execute these commands in the command line
```
javac src\main\Main.java src1\first\MyDummySingleton.java
javac src2\first\MyDummySingleton.java  
java -cp src;src1;src2 main.Main
java -cp src;src2;src1 main.Main
```

After executing those commands, you probably got two different outputs, 
despite the fact that nothing was changed except the order of the classpath.
